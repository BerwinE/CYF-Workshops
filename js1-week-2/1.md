# Predict => Run => Observe => Explain

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctr + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

In this task, you'll need to look at some code in `1.js` and, firstly, predict what it will do, **without executing it**.

{YOUR PREDICTION HERE}
prediction:
it will result in either of these two options:

- an error because we are calling a function that does not exist and is in itself a variable and we cannot call a variable.

Afterwards, you can execute the code in `1.js` to check your answer üìù
