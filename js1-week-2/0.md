# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:

Consider the code in this program below:

```js -->

function calculateSum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer?

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`

{YOUR ANSWERS HERE}
a) it evaluates to 42 but when running the code it is not appearing in the output. we need to write console.log(result1); in order to appear.
b) it will return undefined because the function does not have a return statement.
c) calculateSum: returns the result without logging it to the console.
longSum: logs the result to the console but does not return it.
