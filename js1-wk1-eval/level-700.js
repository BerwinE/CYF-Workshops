let total = console.log(10,32);

console.log(total);

// Without running the code, predict and explain what total will evaluate to
// Use the JS1 Week 1 prep to help you work 
the console.log()will print 10 and 32 but it will not return a value assigned to the variable total. and because it doen not return a value it will return undefined.
